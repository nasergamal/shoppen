## the Story
The decision to embark on an e-commerce project was fueled by the realization that e-commerce is a wide and complex domain, and I had little understanding of its intricacies. With Shoppen being my first project, I saw an opportunity to merge the uncharted territories of e-commerce with the learning experience of developing with Django.
